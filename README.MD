# Kinesis Stapelberg Mod in KiCAD

This is a fork of Aaron Silman's [kinesismod project](https://gitlab.com/Silman/kinesismod.git).  You can read more about [on his blog](https://silman.io/project/kinesis_mod/)

This fork contains the following changes:

* Created a version that uses the Teensy 4.x
* Created a version that uses the STM32F411 Blackpill controller (`blackpill` directory)
* Use Vial firmware (`firmware` directory).  Source code in my [fork of Vial](https://github.com/dcpedit/vial-qmk/tree/vial/keyboards/dcpedit/kint_bp)
