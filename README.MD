# Kinesis Stapelberg Mod in KiCAD

This is a fork of https://gitlab.com/Silman/kinesismod.git and contains the following changes:

* Modify PCB to support a Teensy 4.x

Stapelberg mod ported to KiCAD and slightly reduced board size to reap cost benefits from cheap PCB fabs.

KinesisMod directory stores the port

brd_to_kicad_auto is a test of KiCADs automatic brd import, don't trust it for the port, it is for sanity checks only and even then I barely used it.
