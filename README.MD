# Kinesis Stapelberg Mod in KiCAD

This is a fork of https://gitlab.com/Silman/kinesismod.git and contains the following changes:

* Add support for Teensy 4.x
* Add support for Bluepill controller (`blackpill` directory)
* Use Vial firmware (`firmware` directory).  Source code in my [fork of Vial](https://github.com/dcpedit/vial-qmk/tree/vial/keyboards/dcpedit/kint_bp)
