This is a fork of Aaron Silman's [kinesismod project](https://gitlab.com/Silman/kinesismod.git).  You can read more about it [on his blog](https://silman.io/project/kinesis_mod/)

This fork contains the following changes:

* Created a version that uses the Teensy 4.x
* Created a version that uses the STM32F411 Blackpill controller (`blackpill` directory)
* Use Vial firmware (`firmware` directory).
* Use ZMK firmware (`firmware` directory) wireless PillBug BLE option.


## USB Port

I recommend purchasing the following adapter from Amazon:

Here's how it looks like after installing:

## Wireless Bluetooth + ZMK
Bluetooth has been verified to work using the PillBug development board.  Below, you can see a 2000mAh 3.7V battery ([Amazon link](https://a.co/d/dVUdHxi)), as well as a 10mm push button ([Amazon link](https://a.co/d/5OVO4dY)) to disconnect the power when needed.
